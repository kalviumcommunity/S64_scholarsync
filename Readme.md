# ScholarSync üéì

**Automated Scholarship Eligibility Checker**

ScholarSync is an intelligent AI-powered system that analyzes student profiles to identify and suggest eligible scholarships, helping students discover funding opportunities they might otherwise miss.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Profile Analysis**: Analyzes student academic background, location, field of study, and special categories
- **Eligibility Matching**: Uses AI to match students with relevant scholarship opportunities
- **Structured Results**: Provides organized scholarship information with amounts and deadlines
- **Real-time Database**: Fetches up-to-date scholarship information through RAG implementation
- **Multi-category Support**: Covers various student demographics and academic fields

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### System Architecture

The project demonstrates key AI/ML concepts:

- **System Prompt Engineering**: Configured as an academic assistant specialized in scholarship guidance
- **Tuning Parameters**: Optimized for reliable, factual responses (Temperature: 0.3)
- **Structured Output**: JSON-formatted results for easy integration
- **Function Calling**: Modular functions for profile processing and database queries
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Real-time scholarship database integration

### Core Components

#### 1. System Prompt
```
"You are an academic assistant helping students find and apply for scholarships they are eligible for."
```

#### 2. User Prompt Examples
- "I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student in India. What scholarships can I apply for?"
- "Are there any scholarships for women in engineering?"
- "Show me scholarships for international students in biotechnology"

#### 3. Tuning Parameters
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (Low temperature for factual, consistent responses)
- **Max Tokens**: 1000 (Sufficient for detailed scholarship information)

#### 4. Structured Output Format
```json
{
  "student_profile": {
    "year": "3rd year",
    "field": "Computer Science",
    "location": "India",
    "special_category": "Women in STEM"
  },
  "eligible_scholarships": [
    {
      "name": "Women in Engineering Scholarship",
      "amount": "‚Çπ50,000",
      "deadline": "30th September 2025",
      "eligibility": "Female students in engineering",
      "provider": "Tech Foundation India"
    },
    {
      "name": "Tech Leaders of Tomorrow",
      "amount": "‚Çπ75,000",
      "deadline": "15th October 2025",
      "eligibility": "CS students with 3.5+ GPA",
      "provider": "Innovation Hub"
    }
  ],
  "match_score": 85,
  "next_steps": "Visit respective websites and apply before deadlines."
}
```

#### 5. Function Calling Implementation
```
def fetchStudentProfile(inputs):
    """Extract and structure student information from input"""
    pass

def queryScholarshipDatabase(profile):
    """Query scholarship database based on student profile"""
    pass

def calculateEligibility(student_profile, scholarship_criteria):
    """Calculate match score between student and scholarship requirements"""
    pass
```

#### 6. RAG Integration
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches current scholarship databases and eligibility updates
- **Knowledge Base**: Maintains updated information on scholarship requirements
- **Context Retrieval**: Pulls relevant scholarship information based on student queries

## üéØ Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Undergraduate Students**: Finding scholarships for current academic year
- **Graduate Students**: Research and merit-based funding opportunities
- **International Students**: Location-specific and diversity scholarships
- **Specialized Fields**: STEM, Arts, Business, and other field-specific funding

### Example Scenarios

1. **Computer Science Student**: 
   - Input: "3rd-year CS student, female, India"
   - Output: Women in tech scholarships, CS-specific grants, regional opportunities

2. **International Graduate Student**:
   - Input: "MS in Biotechnology, international student in USA"
   - Output: International student scholarships, biotech research grants, university-specific funding

3. **Undergraduate Arts Student**:
   - Input: "2nd-year Fine Arts student, low-income family"
   - Output: Need-based scholarships, arts-specific grants, state funding programs

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API / Anthropic Claude API
- Vector Database (Pinecone/Weaviate)
- JSON processing libraries
- Web scraping tools (for database updates)
```

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Configure API keys for AI model access
4. Set up vector database for RAG implementation
5. Initialize scholarship database
6. Run the application
